Recursion: Whren a function calls itself until a specified condition is met.

** The main thing we have to take care in recursion is that there must be two things in the recusrsive function:
1: Stopping(Base Condition)
2: Recursive function

Why Use Recursion When We Can Solve It Without It?
Your question is very valid! In many cases, recursion seems to make things more complicated than necessary. However, recursion is important because:

1: Simplifies Complex Problems:
Some problems (e.g., tree traversal, backtracking, dynamic programming) are naturally recursive, and solving them iteratively would be more difficult.
Example: Tower of Hanoi, DFS traversal of a graph/tree, Sudoku solver.

2: Reduces Code Complexity:
In problems like reversing an array or checking a palindrome, recursion removes the need for explicit loops and makes the logic more declarative.

3: Useful in Functional Programming:
Many modern languages (Haskell, Lisp) use recursion as a primary tool instead of loops.
In functional programming, recursion avoids side effects and helps in pure function execution.

4: Divide and Conquer Algorithms:
Algorithms like Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search heavily rely on recursion.
They are much easier to implement recursively than iteratively.

When Should You Avoid Recursion?
If a problem can be easily solved iteratively, recursion might introduce extra overhead due to function call stack usage.
In some cases, recursion can lead to stack overflow if the recursion depth is too high.
Iterative solutions are often more memory-efficient.
